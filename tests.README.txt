Build it fully optimized with: make FINAL=3

There are some #defines to play with server settings in Server.h

More info on how to start/stop the server is in main.cpp (Notes)

Test #1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I run this as my MacOS X machine’s DNS server.

You may already have that port in use and you’ll have to stop that process first.

In that case:
	sudo lsof -i :53 | grep LISTEN, to get the pid
	stop any server on 53 (if any), run this one as root.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test #2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run ./lotsOfDigs.pl in more than one terminal at once. You really need to run
quite a few of these simultaneously to give the server a good beating.

You can add more domains, edit the dig parameters etc. Ctrl+C to end it. You
can also tweak it to send nothing but random domains if you like.
